## FAQ


**How do I backup my MySQL database?**

1. Use phpMyAdmin
2. Use Adminer
3. use `mysqldump` from your host computer
4. use `mysqldump` from within the php container

**Why are mounted MySQL data directories separated by version?**

This is just a pre-caution. Imagine they would link to the same datadir. You start the devilbox with mysql 5.5, create a database and add some data. Now you decide to switch to mysql 5.7 and restart the devilbox. The newer mysql version will probably upgrade the data leaving it unable to start with older mysql versions.

**Why are mounted PostgreSQL data directories separated by version?**

**Why do the user/group permissions of log/ or cfg/ directories show 1000?**
