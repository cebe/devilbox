## Emails

You can send emails from within your PHP projects without having to worry to accidentally sending them out.

All emails to whatever recipients are kept inside by a catch-all functionality from within the `php` container (using postfix).

In order to view the sent emails, use the bundled devilbox intranet and go to the Emails menu. For more information about this see the **[Intranet](Intranet.md)** section.
